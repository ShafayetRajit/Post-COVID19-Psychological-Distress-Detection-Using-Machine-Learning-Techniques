# Post COVID-19 Psychological Distress Detection Using Machine Learning Techniques

We aimed to create a machine learning model which will predict
whether one is suffering from anxiety or other mental health problems. This project also focuses
on finding out how much COVID-19 has affected our mental health in the long
run.

Machine learning techniques used: **Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Tree**.

The data collection form consisted of two parts. One of them was on personal and demographic information, and the other one was a popular anxiety
assessment questionnaire, _GAD-7_.
