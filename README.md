# Post COVID-19 Psychological Distress Detection Using Machine Learning Techniques

This project was done for Junior Design Course (CSE299). We aimed to create a machine learning model which will predict
whether one is suffering from anxiety or other mental health problems. This project also focuses
on finding out how much COVID-19 has affected our mental health in the long
run.

The data collection form consisted of two parts. One of them was on personal and demographic information, and the other one was a popular anxiety
assessment questionnaire, _GAD-7_.
